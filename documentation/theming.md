Theming
===

Overview
---

Theming is used to customize the look and feel of SproutCore UI and add
branding to an application.

Themes can override either the styling of the bundled controls, or
override how they're rendering completely. 

Usage
---

A theme consists of two components:

1. A `my-theme.scss` file which defines CSS rules of the theme
2. A collection of `component.handlebars` which form the templates used
   to render the various components
